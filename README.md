 _Thanks to Nicky for taking care of me on GitHub. She's been a great asset!_  

* Because R code takes up so much space in the text, I shortened most of the R code for the **graphics** in Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4

* The actual code used in the text *for the graphics* is listed in these xxx.R files.  

* The code for data analysis is shown in the text exactly as it was used.  All that stuff is on the [website for the text](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/).

* I used grid.r instead of writing out the details each time... that's listed here too.

* Chapter 7 code is long, so there is a different file for each example in that directory.
