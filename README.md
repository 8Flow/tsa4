* Because R code takes up so much space in the text, most of the R code for the *graphics* in Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, Edition 4 was shortened to the minimum number of lines needed to get a decent plot.

* The actual code used in the text *for the graphics* is listed in these xxx.R files.  

* The code for *data analysis* is shown in the text exactly as it was used.  All that stuff is on the [website for the text](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/).

* `grid.r` as listed here was used instead of writing out the details each time... the change was to `col = gray(.9), lty = 1` in the defaults from the original `col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted"` ... not a big deal but a pain if it's called a lot.


* Chapter 7 code is long, so there is a different file for each example in that directory.
